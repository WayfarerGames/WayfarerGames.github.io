# Free vs Pro: What's the difference?

First off, the **core engine is exactly the same**. Both versions use the same high-performance `BulletSpawner` and module system. We didn't cripple the free version—it's fully capable of handling thousands of bullets.

## The main difference: Convenience

The Pro version is basically a "batteries included" pack. It comes with a bunch of advanced modules pre-built and tested, so you don't have to write them yourself.

**But here's the secret:** You can build almost everything in the Pro version yourself using the Free version's module API. If you're comfortable with C#, the sky's the limit.

## Feature Breakdown

| Feature | Free Version | Pro Version |
|---|---|---|
| **Core Engine** | ✅ Included | ✅ Included |
| **Basic Modules** (Speed, Size, Color, etc.) | ✅ Included | ✅ Included |
| **Homing / Tracking Bullets** | 🛠️ Build it yourself | ✅ Ready to use |
| **Force Fields / Magnetism** | 🛠️ Build it yourself | ✅ Ready to use |
| **Bouncing / Ricochet** | 🛠️ Build it yourself | ✅ Ready to use |
| **Sub-Spawners** (Spawn on hit/death) | 🛠️ Build it yourself | ✅ Ready to use |
| **Rewind / Replay System** | 🛠️ Build it yourself | ✅ Ready to use |
| **Deterministic Randomness** | 🛠️ Build it yourself | ✅ Ready to use |

## Which one is right for you?

- **Stick with Free if:** You're a hobbyist, a student, or a programmer who loves writing custom behavior. You want full control and don't mind getting your hands dirty with code.
- **Go Pro if:** You're a professional developer or a team who needs to ship fast. You want complex behaviors (like homing missiles or bouncing lasers) working in seconds, not hours.
