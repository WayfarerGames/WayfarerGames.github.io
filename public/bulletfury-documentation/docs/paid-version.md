## Why upgrade?

The Pro version is designed to save you time. It includes pre-built modules for:

- **Homing Missiles**
- **Bouncing / Ricochet**
- **Force Fields**
- **Sub-Spawners** (bullets that spawn other bullets)
- **Rewind / Replay**

It's the same engine, just with more toys in the box.

## Free vs Pro: What's the difference?

First off, the **core engine is exactly the same**. Both versions use the same high-performance `BulletSpawner` and module system. We didn't cripple the free version, it is fully capable of handling thousands of bullets.

### The main difference: convenience

The Pro version is basically a "batteries included" pack. It comes with advanced modules pre-built and tested, so you do not have to write them yourself.

**But here's the secret:** You can build almost everything in the Pro version yourself using the Free version's module API. If you are comfortable with C#, the sky is the limit.

### Feature breakdown

| Feature | Free Version | Pro Version |
|---|---|---|
| **Core Engine** | Included | Included |
| **Basic Modules** (Speed, Size, Color, etc.) | Included | Included |
| **Homing / Tracking Bullets** | Build it yourself | Ready to use |
| **Force Fields / Magnetism** | Build it yourself | Ready to use |
| **Bouncing / Ricochet** | Build it yourself | Ready to use |
| **Sub-Spawners** (Spawn on hit/death) | Build it yourself | Ready to use |
| **Rewind / Replay System** | Build it yourself | Ready to use |
| **Deterministic Randomness** | Build it yourself | Ready to use |

### Which one is right for you?

- **Stick with Free if:** You are a hobbyist, a student, or a programmer who loves writing custom behavior. You want full control and do not mind building features yourself.
- **Go Pro if:** You are shipping on a timeline and want complex behaviors like homing missiles and ricochet patterns ready immediately.
