Awesome! Bulletfury is designed to be extended, and writing your own modules is surprisingly easy. How it works \u00b6 Custom modules are just C# classes. You don't need to inherit from MonoBehaviour \u2014just implement one of the module interfaces, and Bulletfury will pick it up automatically. The Rules \u00b6 For your module to show up in the Inspector, it must be: [Serializable] A normal class (not abstract) Have a default constructor (which C# gives you for free usually) Choose your weapon (Interface) \u00b6 IBulletSpawnModule : Run this before a bullet is born. Good for changing where it spawns. IBulletInitModule : Run this once when a bullet is born. Good for setting initial stats. IBulletModule : Run this every frame . This is where the magic happens (movement, color, etc.). IBulletDieModule : Run this when a bullet hits something. Want bouncing bullets? This is the place. Example 1: Making bullets drift sideways \u00b6 Let's make a module that pushes bullets to the right over time. using System; using BulletFury; using BulletFury.Data; using UnityEngine; namespace MyGame.BulletModules { [Serializable] // We implement IParallelBulletModule to say \"this is safe to run on multiple threads!\" public class SideDriftModule : IBulletModule, IParallelBulletModule { [SerializeField] private float driftSpeed = 1f; public void Execute(ref BulletContainer container, float deltaTime) { // Move along the bullet's local right vector container.Position += container.Right * driftSpeed * deltaTime; } } } Example 2: Custom spawn offset \u00b6 Want to shift the spawn point a bit? using System; using BulletFury; using UnityEngine; namespace MyGame.BulletModules { [Serializable] public class SpawnOffsetModule : IBulletSpawnModule { [SerializeField] private Vector3 localOffset = new Vector3(0.5f, 0f, 0f); public void Execute(ref Vector3 position, ref Quaternion rotation, float deltaTime) { position += localOffset; } } } Example 3: Ignoring certain colliders \u00b6 By default, bullets die when they hit anything.

A note on performance (Parallel vs Main Thread) \u00b6 If you implement IParallelBulletModule , your code will run on worker threads. This is much faster , but it has rules: Don't touch Unity APIs (like transform , GameObject.Find , Physics ). Don't change global variables. Do stick to math and the BulletContainer data. If you need to touch Unity stuff, just implement IBulletModule (without IParallel... ) and it will run safely on the main thread.

This guide will take you from zero to seeing your first bullets flying across the screen. 1) Install the package \u00b6 First things first, add Bulletfury to your Unity project's Packages/manifest.json : \"com.wayfarergames.bulletfury\": \"https://github.com/<your-org>/<your-repo>.git?path=/PackageSource/com.wayfarergames.bulletfury\" Just a reminder: Bulletfury needs Unity 6+ and URP . It also relies on a few Unity packages like Burst and Mathematics, but those should install automatically. 2) Create a spawner object \u00b6 Now for the fun part! Create an empty GameObject in your scene. Add the BulletSpawner component to it. You'll see a few sections in the inspector: Render Data : How your bullets look. Main : Basic bullet properties like speed and lifetime. Spawn Shape Data : Where bullets come from (circle, line, point, etc.). Burst Data : How many bullets fire at once. 3) Make it visible \u00b6 Before we can see anything, we need to tell Bulletfury how to draw the bullets. In Render Data : Assign your Main Camera . Assign a Texture2D for your bullet sprite. (Crucial! If you don't set this, nothing will show up.) Set the sorting Layer and Priority if you need them to appear on top of other things. 4) Configure the basics \u00b6 Let's set up a simple stream of bullets. In Main : Set FireMode to Automatic so it starts firing right away. Check PlayOnEnable . Set FireRate to 0.1 (that's 10 shots per second). Set Lifetime to 1.5 seconds. Set Speed to 5 . In Spawn Shape Data (let's keep it simple for now): numPoints : 1 numPerSide : 1 radius : 0 spawnDir : Direction In Burst Data : burstCount : 1 delay : 0 5) Fire! \u00b6 Hit Play Mode . If everything is set up right, you should see a stream of bullets shooting out! Manual spawning \u00b6 Want to control when bullets fire? Set FireMode to Manual and use a script like this: using BulletFury; using UnityEngine; public class ManualFireExample : MonoBehaviour { [SerializeField] private BulletSpawner spawner; private void Update() { if (Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.Space)) { // Fire! spawner.Spawn(transform.position, transform.up, Time.deltaTime); } } } Here are the main methods you'll use: Spawn(Transform obj, float deltaTime) : Uses the transform's position and rotation. Spawn(Vector3 position, Vector3 up, float deltaTime) : Uses a specific position and direction. SpawnImmediate(...) : Fires instantly, ignoring the fire rate. Controlling the simulation \u00b6 You can also control the spawner at runtime: Play() / Stop() : Start or stop the automatic firing. SetSimulationPaused(bool paused) : Pause all bullets in mid-air. ClearBullets() : Remove all active bullets. ActivateWaitingBullets() : Release bullets that are waiting (great for complex patterns). Troubleshooting \u00b6 If things aren't working, check these common issues: No bullets visible? Did you assign a texture in Render Data ? Is the camera assigned? Is the spawner object active? Bullets not firing in manual mode? Are you calling Spawn() ? Check if FireRate or Delay is preventing shots. Bullets vanish immediately? Check Lifetime in Main settings. Check if they're hitting something immediately (collision settings).","title":"Setup and First Spawn"},{"location":"getting-started/setup-and-first-spawn/#setup-and-first-spawn","text":"Let's get you up and running!

These modules are the building blocks for creating all sorts of patterns. You can add any of these to your BulletSpawner component in the Inspector. How modules work \u00b6 Think of modules as little scripts that run at specific times in a bullet's life: Spawn Modules : Run before the bullet is created (to set position/rotation). Init Modules : Run once when the bullet is born. Update Modules : Run every frame while the bullet is alive. Die Modules : Run when the bullet hits something or expires. The Modules \u00b6 SpawnerRotateModule \u00b6 Make it spin! What it does : Rotates the spawner over time. Perfect for : Spirals, rotating fans, spinning rings. Key setting : angularSpeed (how fast it spins in degrees per second). SpeedOverTimeModule \u00b6 Faster! Slower! What it does : Changes the bullet's speed over its lifetime. Perfect for : Bullets that start slow and speed up, or pulse in speed. Key settings : Draw a curve for speed over time. AngularVelocityModule \u00b6 Curved shots What it does : Rotates the bullet's direction over time. Perfect for : Wavy patterns, boomerangs, or spiraling shots. Key settings : Draw a curve for rotation speed over time. BulletSizeOverTimeModule \u00b6 Grow and shrink What it does : Changes the bullet's size. Perfect for : Popping bullets into existence, or shrinking them as they fade out. Key settings : Draw a curve for size over time. BulletColorOverTimeModule \u00b6 Pretty colors What it does : Tints the bullet color over its life. Perfect for : Fading bullets out, or making them \"heat up\" as they travel. Key settings : Set a gradient for color over time. BulletDamageOverTimeModule \u00b6 Damage falloff What it does : Changes how much damage a bullet does based on how long it's been alive. Perfect for : Shotguns (high damage close up, low damage far away). Key settings : Draw a curve for damage multiplier. WaitToContinueModule \u00b6 Wait for it... What it does : Pauses bullets after a certain time, waiting for a signal to continue. Perfect for : \"Trace then release\" patterns, or freezing bullets in place before launching them at the player. How to use : Call spawner.ActivateWaitingBullets() in your code to release them. Want more? \u00b6 The Pro version includes even more modules like Homing/Tracking , Force Fields , Bouncing , and Sub-Spawners . But don't worry, the free version is plenty powerful for most games!

Here are a few recipes using just the free modules. Feel free to tweak the numbers and make them your own! 1. Straight Stream \u00b6 The classic \"pew pew\" Great for basic enemies or player weapons. Main Settings: FireMode : Automatic FireRate : 0.1 (fast) Speed : 6 Lifetime : 2 Spawn Shape: numPoints : 1 spawnDir : Direction Modules: None needed! 2. Radial Burst \u00b6 The \"shockwave\" Spawns a ring of bullets expanding outward. Main Settings: FireMode : Automatic (or Manual for explosions) FireRate : 1.0 (slow) Spawn Shape: numPoints : 24 (more points = smoother circle) radius : 0 arc : 360 spawnDir : Spherised (this makes them shoot outward from the center) Burst Data: burstCount : 1 (single ring) Try 3 with a small burstDelay for a triple-ring effect! 3. Rotating Spiral \u00b6 The \"bullet hell staple\" A single stream that spins around, creating a beautiful spiral. Base Settings: Start with the Straight Stream above. Add Module: SpawnerRotateModule angularSpeed : 120 (spin speed) Polish: Add SpeedOverTimeModule to make the spiral expand faster or slower as it goes out. Add BulletColorOverTimeModule to make it look hypnotic. 4. Wave Stream \u00b6 The \"wobbly laser\" A stream of bullets that speeds up and slows down, creating a wave effect. Base Settings: Start with the Straight Stream . Add Module: SpeedOverTimeModule Curve : Make it go up and down (e.g., 0.8 -> 1.2 -> 0.8). Mode : Time (loops the curve) Time : 0.8 (how fast the wave pulses) 5. Hold & Release \u00b6 The \"wait for it...\" Spawn bullets, freeze them in place, then launch them all at once. Setup: Add WaitToContinueModule . Set timeToPlayBeforeWaiting to a small number (like 0.5 ) so they fly out a bit and then stop. Trigger: Call this in your code when you're ready to fire: spawner.ActivateWaitingBullets(); Great for: Boss attacks where you want to telegraph the pattern before it becomes dangerous. 6. Shotgun Blast \u00b6 The \"boomstick\" A random spread of bullets in a cone. Main Settings: FireMode : Manual Spawn Shape: numPoints : 10 spawnDir : Randomised directionArc : 30 (how wide the spread is) randomise : true Trigger: if (Input.GetMouseButtonDown(0)) spawner.Spawn(transform, Time.deltaTime); Tuning Tips \u00b6 Too dense? Lower numPoints or increase FireRate (higher number = slower fire). Too slow? Increase Speed . Laggy? Reduce the number of modules or total bullet count.
