    "content": "<div class=\"sqs-html-content\">\n <p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">We’re done. I reached it. The end. Polyfury is in review, due to be released on Monday on Steam. </p>\n</div>\n<div>\n <a\n  href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/1804980/Polyfury/\"\n  class=\"sqs-block-button-element--large sqs-button-element--secondary sqs-block-button-element\"\n >\n  GO WISHLIST IT RIGHT NOW\n </a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sqs-html-content\">\n <h2 style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>What even happened</strong></h2><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">I made a game! Polyfury is a circular bullet hell with 7 levels. The longest level is about 3 minutes, you can beat the game in 15 minutes if you’re good. Most people will take a <strong>lot</strong> longer than that, though. Over the last <strong>100 days</strong> (excluding Sundays), I have worked on the game <strong>every single day.</strong> Sometimes, just half an hour. Once, 20 hours in a single day. That wasn’t a good day. Polyfury started life as a Ludum Dare entry, <a href=\"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/47/event-horizon/polyfury-a-postmortem\">read the postmortem</a> I did of that one. Because of that jam, I cancelled my other main project at the time and thought “hey - I can make this in no time at all”. That was <strong>three years ago.</strong> Suffice to say I was incorrect. </p>\n</div>\n  <div>\n    <figure>\n     <div>\n      <div class=\"sqs-image-shape-container-element\n       has-aspect-ratio\n      \" \n       >\n        <img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/6086d006dce47b2b3ccc28ec/1694727298351-A8LCV05SZS5WB870WQS1/1000008087.gif\">\n      </div>\n     </div>\n    </figure>\n  </div>\n<div class=\"sqs-html-content\">\n <h2 style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>Euroshmup beginnings</strong></h2><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">It started life as what the shmup community generally refers to as a “euroshmup” - it’s a somewhat derogatory term for games that don’t really get why shmups are fun, and it absolutely applied to the original version of Polyfury. There were a ton of bullets, sure, but you were basically forced to get hit by a lot of them. The movement was insane, really fast and uncontrollable. There wasn’t really a way to earn score, and it just didn’t “feel” right. It got a lot of positive feedback from the LD community, but there was definitely something missing.</p>\n</div>\n  <div>\n    <figure>\n     <div>\n      <div class=\"sqs-image-shape-container-element\n       has-aspect-ratio\n      \" \n       >\n        <img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/6086d006dce47b2b3ccc28ec/e5e984cf-bf5b-4002-af93-dba560eedebc/367bd.gif\">\n      </div>\n     </div>\n    </figure>\n  </div>\n<div class=\"sqs-html-content\">\n <p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">I originally intended to release it as a quick little iOS game with 3 or 4 levels, maybe make some money from it, and move on. I realised, however, that this “short” project was an ideal candidate to fulfill a dream I’ve had since I realised making your own games was possible, around the age of 10 - I could get this game on Xbox. The scope was small, it didn’t have high demands for art or music or anything that I wasn’t already comfortable with. I could actually <strong>do it. </strong>I applied to ID@Xbox, and got accepted 🎉</p><h2 style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>Smooth sailing</strong></h2><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">At that point, it was no longer a small project. Getting stuff working on Xbox was <strong>tough</strong>, and a full rewrite was needed. Once that was done, though, it was smooth sailing - just a bunch of content right?</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Wrong!</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">I got the tech working, and a spot in the ID@Xbox Summer Demo Fest in 2022. The first level was done, I was pretty happy with it and got a bunch of great feedback. I’d had a successful Kickstarter that raised a little over £1,000, so I even had external pressure. But I burnt out <strong>hard</strong>. Getting it ready for the demo fest killed me a little bit, I had such a short amount of time to get things ready and after that, I couldn’t stand working on it for a while. An entire year passed. I got the Pentagon level done, which was cool, but progress was slow. I wasn’t really treating it like something that was ever going to be “finished”. I had no deadline, I had no goal or anything like that. I was just working on it every now and then because “I need to work on it”. </p><h2 style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>Okay, maybe not smooth sailing</strong></h2><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">On top of that burnout, the baby was born about 6 months before. I don’t recommend trying to finish a game as a new parent 😂 I have loved every minute of being a parent, but it’s a full time job on top of the day job, and hobbies just sort of disappear for a while. Plus, it’s a pretty convenient excuse. “Hey Dom, it’s been a year since your intended release date for Kickstarter, why are there only two levels” - baby! Really, though, it was an excuse. I just wasn’t feeling like working on the game, and it was tough. I considered cancelling the project many times, but if I couldn’t take this “tiny project” past the finish line, I really wasn’t going to do anything else. Stubbornness prevailed.</p><h2 style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>The road to release</strong></h2><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Steam announced their first Shmup Fest, and suddenly I had a deadline. If I didn’t get the game done before shmup fest, Polyfury was either never getting finished, or wasn’t going to sell anything. I’m not hugely doing this to get money, but I’d like to make back at least a little of what I spent. I convinced myself that this was it, it was shmup fest or cancelled project. I could actually finish this, and I could do it in 100 days. Hey, that would be a cool idea for a blog, and would keep me accountable!</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">You can read the first day <a href=\"https://wayfarer-games.com/road-to-release/day-one\">here</a>, and I did genuinely work and post every day, except one while I was on holiday because the internet died and my scheduled posts ran out, and forgetting to post early this week because my brain was dead. What a difference this little blog made. There’s a lot to be said for accountability, and without it I don’t think I’d have forced myself to work as consistently as I did. Without it, Polyfury would not be on the cusp of release.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">I’m going to write up a proper postmortem of the game once it’s actually in the wild and people have bought it. I will be as open as I can be about sales figures, though I expect neither Steam nor Xbox will want me to share full figues. Sign up to the mailing list below to be notified of that!</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Thank you for reading, and if you’ve been following along - thank you for being part of the journey. If not, click some of the links around ;) try the game, <a href=\"https://discord.gg/Et5SpCc\">join the Discord</a>, say hello!</p>\n</div>\n<hr />",

Tomorrow is going to be almost entirely <em>writing</em>, and I’m no good at that. I’m dreading it a little.</p><h2 style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>What’s next?</strong></h2><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Tomorrow I have posts to write and the presskit to do.

That’s not good. I didn’t want to crunch on this project, but alas - Xbox stuff has been STINKY. Also, when you do an all nighter then 20 hours of work, you make mistakes. Big dumb mistakes that end up costing enough time to make a nap worth it. Don’t do what I do.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Today’s big dumb mistake was that I missed something wrapped in #if !UNITY_EDITOR - which means the code only runs in a build. This is great for all of the Xbox stuff that stops it running in the editor, means I can test much more quickly without having to build every time, but when there’s a bug there it is VERY difficult to figure out… I must’ve made 30+ builds today alone, each one taking upwards of 5 minutes. That’s 2 and a half hours just sat waiting for Unity to chug along. I haven’t felt this frustrated with game development for a long time, and I will be incredibly happy to put Windows in the bin, boot up a nice fresh Linux install, and do away with Microsoft entirely. I doubt I’ll be making another Xbox game, but it was on my game dev bucket list so it’s pretty cathartic to have that <em>almost</em> ticked off!</p><h2 style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>What’s next?</strong></h2><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Tomorrow I sleep, I email press, and I make a new trailer. Also play the game intensely for the majority of the day.</p>\n</div>\n<hr />",

It’s a tough one, but hot damn is it fun.

There’s a nice big gap in the red circles for you to travel in near the player, and the symmetry of the pattern means there’s another gap opposite where the player is here, which allows you to get behind the pattern if you’re on a controller. It’s not a required move, but if you can pull off what is a pretty difficult trick, you’re rewarded with a bit more room to breathe and a clearer shot at the boss.</p><h2 style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>What’s next?</strong></h2><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">More octagon!

    "title": "Addressing Randomness: Setting Pattern Order",
    "content": "<div class=\"sqs-html-content\">\n <p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">This week has started well - over the weekend I had a LOT of feedback from some of the people who have been playing for a couple of years now. There were a couple of complaints with how the game works in general, you might not even have noticed yourself.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">The big one is an issue of randomness. Broadly, the game has three types of randomness:</p><ul data-rte-list=\"default\"><li><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Randomly <strong>selecting</strong> attacks</p></li><li><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Randomly <strong>altering</strong> attacks</p></li><li><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Randomly changing things that don’t affect gameplay</p></li></ul><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">The aim of randomness, generally, is to change up the gameplay. People who play a lot will see the same thing over and over again, and that gets boring. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">In my head, that also extended to people who <strong>don’t</strong> play a lot, too, so boss attacks were <strong>selected</strong> randomly. That meant that other than the intro and phase change animations, you never really knew which attack was going to come next. On paper, this sounds great! It keeps you on your toes, it makes playing for score different every time, that’s good right?</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>Wrong</strong>. Well, mostly! Variety is good, and bosses in most other genres pick their attacks randomly to keep the player guessing. But in a game like this, where playing for score means optimising <strong>every single movement</strong>, that randomness gets frustrating fast. It becomes a game of “can I get the order of attacks that means I can get the highest score”, which isn’t controllable at all. If it isn’t controllable, it isn’t enjoyable for people who really play for score.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Randomly altering attacks, on the other hand, doesn’t affect things on that large a scale. I don’t actually use true random in many of the patterns in Polyfury. I actually just mash the player’s position up (the trigonometry functions are great for this) so there’s still a degree of… not control perhaps, but definitely <strong>repeatability</strong>, which is good. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">All that to say, now the order of patterns is set. That update should be live at some point today, so hopefully it makes playing for score a bit more skill-based and a bit less “RNGsus hates me”!</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Oh, and I did some more Heptagon today. </p><h2 style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>What’s next?</strong></h2><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">More Heptagon, and I need to put the triangles and heptagon into beta ASAP.</p>\n</div>\n<hr />",

About 50% of the time I started coroutines the usual way - StartCoroutine(SomeCoroutine());. The other 50% I used my fancy corutine runner - SomeCoroutine().Run(); - which is basically there because you can’t run coroutines from objects that don’t inherit from MonoBehaviour. It’s usually great, but when I’m <strong>stopping</strong> coroutines, i.e. to kill all the animations and boss patterns when a boss dies, I use StopAllCoroutines, which stops all the corouintes <strong>on the current object</strong>. This works perfectly on the coroutines I started normally, but my fancy coroutine runner has its own seperate object - so any coroutines started with Run() just didn’t stop. Hence bosses behaving badly when they died.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">People tell me I’m clever, I rarely believe them.</p><h2 style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>What’s next?</strong></h2><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Some real Heptagram progress, I swear.</p>\n</div>\n<hr />",

That’s a hard deadline I’m setting for myself, because we’re <strong>so close </strong>with the content now I can smell the light at the end of the tunnel.

    "title": "Squashing the Low FPS Double Damage Bug",
    "content": "<div class=\"sqs-html-content\">\n <p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Well, I spent 2.5 of today’s 0.5 hours working on the game fixing a major bug 😬 low framerates (~40fps or lower), where the time between frames is at least double the time between fixed update frames, cause bullets to collide twice. That means the player deals double damage against the bosses, which is terrible for a number of reasons. The flag for the bullet being killed isn’t updated until the next real frame redraw, and the bullet isn’t moved until the next real frame redraw, so if two physics updates happen in the same visual frame the game will register that collision twice.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">This has been something of a headache to work my brain through, what you’re reading here is the culmination of many hours of trying to process what’s going on - with the help of @ktyl on the Wayfarer Games Discord server 😄 and even that explanation requires a bunch of knowledge about how Unity works. To be perfectly honest, it was a real effort to work out what was even happening in the first place! There’s a double damage cheat, which I assumed was the actual problem. Once you get in your head that a problem is caused by a specific thing, you lose a lot of time trying to engineer solutions to work around that thing - which ultimately gets you nowhere because it wasn’t even the cause anyway!</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">It’s tough to let go of things like that, but this could’ve lasted a LOT longer. I’m quite impressed that we found the cause (low FPS) as quickly as we did, given how tightly I was holding on to it being the fault of the cheat code… The virtual machine is what did it in the end. I actually managed to get triple damage because the VM ran at such a low framerate that <strong>three</strong> fixed updates were happening in the same visual update. Working out how to fix it was another challenge, but I could simulate the issue by setting Application.targetFramerate to something low enough, which made testing things <strong>much </strong>easier. I’m probably going to have to run it at low FPS consistently during my testing to make sure there are no other issues like this, so I’ve added a keyboard shortcut.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Oh, and my hacky solution was to just do bullet collision checks in Update instead of Fixed Update. Once Polyfury is released, I’ll go back and fix it properly in Bulletfury, and probably Polyfury too with the inevitable post-release bugfix update. Now I’ve worked out what’s actually happening and why, it should be relatively easy to solve.</p><h2 style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>What’s next?</strong></h2><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Heptagram tomorrow.

See, the issue is that this is a 22 second loop - and I absolutely do not want the player to sit around for an extra 22 seconds if they miss it, so there’s a 5 second cap. If you get to the phase transition with less than 5 seconds left on the loop, it will continue nicely as above. You can actually get it to <strong>immediately</strong> phase shift if you time it well enough - keep an eye on the clock, the track is pretty much exactly 22 seconds long so you want to try change the phase at a little before 44s, 43s would be the safe bet, but be aware it will finish the current attack first, so you’ve got to build a few seconds in for that. If you do this, you should be pretty much guaranteed the 4x multiplier for time. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">If you miss that window though, there’s up to 5 seconds where the boss will centre and charge up. You can’t damage it during this time, so you’ll lose precious seconds on the clock, though you’ll still spawn points while hitting it, so you shouldn’t lose your multiplier.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">I’m aiming for all bosses to have this interaction with the music, so it will be the end of sudden audio transitions! Audio synced stuff always feels really good, so it’s nice that I could get this in there today. I’ll tidy up the actual animation and sync it to the audio at some point, too :)</p><h2 style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>What’s next?</strong></h2><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">I really am going to prioritise the Heptagram tomorrow, I won’t have much time to work on it but I’ll try get the intro animation done. That’s always something I put off - I’m no animator, but I think I’ve done ok with the others so far!</p>\n</div>\n<hr />",

The “play” button now starts from the square, and will update with the next level to be beaten once you beat the current level. The level select menu has been moved to “practice”, and there’s a new 1CC mode! I’ve been meaning to add this for ages, it will give you each boss one after the other. No breaks, no life resets, just one straight challenge. I’m tempted to add an achievement for beating it on 1CC mode with the 1 life cheat. Will anyone be able to do the whole thing without making a <em>single mistake?</em> That’s probably a little mean for an achievement, but there has to be SOME reward for doing it.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">I’ve also done some work in getting a “hyper” mode - basically a higher difficulty setting. That’s gonna take a bit of tweaking, but it should be fairly speedy now that the core is in place for it.

I toyed with a ton of different things, but ultimately I went with “your position on the ring is precisely the position of the thumbstick”. I thought it was really cool that I could make the whole game playable with just a single joystick. That’s a neat accessibility consideration, there are very few games designed for teenagers and adults that are built around being played with just one hand. It’s also a really interesting input method that gives the player <strong>full</strong> control… and it is wonderfully simple to code - literally just:</p><pre><code>player.position = thumbstick.normalized * radius;</code></pre><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">You can be at any point on the ring at any time, and you use the joystick in a different way - generally holding it all the way to the edge for the majority of play. It never goes to rest, and it moves around a lot.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">There’s one major issue with this input scheme, however - cheap controllers <strong>will not work</strong>.

A seperate but related issue was the fact that if you didn’t have a controller, you could only use one of the two terrible input methods. Having three input methods (analogue, A/D, A/D with the spinny vomit cam) also came with a bunch of bloat, I had to have an input manager and a way to switch between input methods. Input is handled inside a scriptable object, and there’s a manager that reads from that. This sucks, and yes I said <strong>is</strong> because that’s how it is now, even with just a single input option…</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Enter 2022, a full <strong>year</strong> after development started properly! This needed fixing, I had just ignored it for too long. As a quick fix, I made it so when you’re not using a controller, your position was the normalised mouse position - again, super simple code:</p><pre><code>player.position = mousePos.normalized * radius;</code></pre><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">It was a quick hack to get <em>something</em>, anything in there to make it not suck for keyboard users. Turns out this is the best way to play the game <em>by far</em> 😂 all of my input woes were immediately fixed by this one simple hack. There’s a minor issue in that it is basically impossible to get to the opposite side of the ring immediately, which was a trick that I want to use in later levels. I’ll probably just ditch that as an intended solution to some of the bullet patterns. It’s actually noticably easier with a mouse, so I think having that ability will balance out the difficulty on controller a little bit.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">So uh… What’s the moral of the story? Test things! Test them quickly and early, the solution might be a stupid little hack that you think is going to feel terrible. Also, don’t be afraid to change the input entirely. Being able to prototype things like this quickly basically saved this game. There’s no way I could ship a good PC version and require a controller.</p><h2 style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>What’s next?</strong></h2><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Who knows, maybe another scheduled post, maybe I’m back.

That means so long as we can output to a Texture2D, we can do whatever we like with it! Rendertextures acutally work pretty well for this, so that’s what I use here. I was lazy, and I’ve just got another camera hooked up to a render texture that <strong>only</strong> renders a quad. That quad has a simple shader that samples voronoi noise a few times, and multiplies it with some colour to give it this nice effect:</p>\n</div>\n  <div>\n    <figure>\n     <div>\n      <div class=\"sqs-image-shape-container-element\n       has-aspect-ratio\n      \" \n       >\n        <img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/6086d006dce47b2b3ccc28ec/84bb83e0-c188-4616-ad85-6bad6ce1d70f/vlcsnap-2023-08-02-15h57m20s230.png\">\n      </div>\n     </div>\n    </figure>\n  </div>\n<div class=\"sqs-html-content\">\n <p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">It’s most noticable when there’s a laser, but it also gives bright bullets a bit of extra texture. I did originally try it with a static texture, but it felt incredibly… static 😂 it’s fine for bullets because they move, but on lasers like the screenshot above, it felt really weird. A bit of movement in the texture worked wonders!</p><h2 style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>What’s next?</strong></h2><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Who knows, maybe another scheduled post, maybe I’m back.

Argh, it was just a case of using gameObject.activeInHierarchy instead of activeSelf - there is some code to continue rendering bullets after the object has been disabled, but if the object is re-enabled it should skip that code. It was checking if the object itself was active, and in this case it was the <em>parent </em>that was disabled. Update doesn’t run in that case, so the bullets don’t move - but the renderer hasn’t been disabled. Now it checks all parent objects, and it works perfectly. That was a useful brainwave at 5:30am!</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">I’m a little concerned with how slow I’ve been with content - so much has had to take precedence over the last couple of weeks, I haven’t managed to get much done.

There was also another really minor one that stopped the score pickup count &amp; PB from working properly, which was fixed by… adding one to a number 🫠</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">There are a couple of other really tiny things that I’ve noticed since that all went live - e.g. the first time you beat a boss, your “time” PB shows as the max float value. I should hide that when you haven’t already got a PB. Plus, the score starts at 0 before ticking up, and should start at the score you get before the time multiplier. However, they aren’t really a major concern at this point and I don’t think I’ll be able to get another version through cert before the competition starts, so it can stay like that for now!</p><h2 style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>What’s next?</strong></h2><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">I need to send a bunch of emails on Monday, which is going to take up most of my dev time, but there’ll be more triangle content soon.</p>\n</div>\n<hr />",

This demo event has taken a lot of time, but after this weekend I’ll be back to content content content.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Today, though, I really struggled - I’ve got some <em>intense</em> toothache from a filling that was put in recently, that has made it difficult to concentrate on anything at all. I also had an incredibly long and exhausting day at work, so it’s a miracle I managed to open Polyfury on my lunch break and get anything done at all… </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">But do that I did.

This is basically the whole purpose behind that huge splash screen, which only shows up once but does fill the screen completely, and blocks input for a good few seconds. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">I’m also reaching out to as much press and as many streamers as I can find - so if you’re a streamer of any size and are interested in working with me for this event, there are a couple of things I can offer! 😁 If you haven’t already received an email, you can reach out to <a href=\"mailto:dom@wayfarer-games.com\">dom@wayfarer-games.com</a> to find out more.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">This is my first major marketing push.

I’m also going to do a <strong>Steam event</strong> with a similar marketing push and competition either at the end of this month or the start of the next one, so if you don’t have an Xbox - keep your eyes peeled!</p><h2 style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>What’s next?</strong></h2><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Fixing these pesky bugs, resubmitting to Xbox cert, praying that it goes through before the event 🤞</p>\n</div>\n<hr />",

The crux of the issue was that when you disable a bullet manager, the bullets immediately disappear. If you’ve paid attention to the Pentagon fight, you might notice this - particularly with the spinning pink bullets when a phase changes. I may have had that under my list of “I’m not fixing this unless someone explicitly complains about it”, but I guess this counts as someone explicitly complaining about it!</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Bullets are not gameobjects. They don’t exist as objects, they are just a mesh rendered directly to the screen (usually a quad), with a material and a colour, and a matrix that describes position/rotation/scale.

It’s no longer rendering.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">I’ve spent… more hours than I care to admit doing a quick and dirty fix. It just runs the Update function in a coroutine that starts in OnDisable, and only unsubscribes to the rendering event after that finishes.

This is a boss that shifts forms quite frequently, and in a cyclical pattern - until you defeat one of the triangles, the phases aren’t based on health! Luckily, everything I build is completely overengineered, so that slots in quite nicely. The boss phase controller for this one only has a single phase - the rest is controlled through different objects being enabled and disabled. The phases themselves can be anything, they just have to implement the OnPhaseStart and OnPhaseEnd methods, and call PhaseComplete when they’re done. For this, I’ve built a little state machine into the phase itself, which happily controls switching between the different states:</p><ul data-rte-list=\"default\"><li><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>Hexagram</strong>: the Triangle Twins join together to form a solid hexagram, and favour speedy contact attacks. They’ll be zipping around the screen and trying their best to smash into you</p></li><li><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>Flexagram</strong>: the Twins are still joined together, but rotate independently. This is somewhat of a transitional phase, and features centralised attacks that make pretty patterns.</p></li><li><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>Independent Triangles</strong>: the Twins separate, and favour area-denial attacks. These attacks are a mix of indepentent and coordinated attacks.</p></li></ul><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">This once again feels completely different from the other bosses - the Square is a standard introduction to the mechanics. There’s an easy phase, and a hard phase with sped up attacks. All of the attacks happen one after the other. The Pentagon moves around a lot, and when it changes form it has shields and patterns that can happen together. The Hexagon has three phases, and creates little sub-enemies. I think we’ve managed to make it so they all “feel” completely different, which I’m incredibly happy with tbh!</p>\n</div>\n<hr />",

    "title": "Planning: Autofire Default & Railgun Concept",
    "content": "<div class=\"sqs-html-content\">\n <p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">A short one again - we’re currently preparing the house for a bunch of building work, so not a lot of time for game dev. In terms of actual changes made to the game, I did a few more little bits on the triangle twins but not a lot else. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">In terms of planning, though, we had some great conversations last night and this morning about potential changes to shooting and grazing (sticking close to, but not being hit by, enemy bullets and lasers). Generally, most players will be turning on auto fire and just letting the game shoot for them - this is intentional, it’s a great accessiblity feature and there’s not a great deal of purpose for <strong>not</strong> shooting (discussed a little in the scoring blog post on day 21). Why not make autofire the default? I’ve been meaning to do it anyway, and it removes an input so more people with physical disabilities can enjoy the game.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">But that does leave a bit of a gap - currently, you can make sure you kill the boss at the right moment to turn all of its bullets into points. If you’re forced to always shoot, you don’t really have much control over that (beyond the damage boost you get from grazing). We do have a button available now, and a single press of a button is much easier than holding it down, and has much more depth than an autofire toggle. So why not add a massive railgun :D </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Everyone loves a railgun. They are objectively the most satisfying weapon class, no you can’t disagree - this is not an opinion. If I do go ahead and implement it, it will charge based on the damage you do to the enemy, with the damage boost from grazing meaning it charges more quickly. The thinking is that this will have a few <strong>defensive</strong> properties too - if you hit the boss with it, it will stop their current bullet pattern (cancelling the bullets and turning them into points), and if you’ve just been hit you’ll have a short window to fire and recover a life. I’ll add an accessibility option for this to happen automatically, too, because tight timing windows can be difficult for people with a wide array of disabilities - both motor <em>and </em>cognitive. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">This is just very early thoughts, though, and won’t even be tested for a couple of months at least. It’s a fairly major change, but it would help make the game more approchable, and would add some depth to gameplay!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sqs-html-content\">\n <h2 style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>What’s next?</strong></h2><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">More triangle stuff!

It started out just being a simple timer, but that didn’t really work because your damage output is relatively fixed. It also raised the question of “why have a shoot button at all if it doesn’t make any difference”. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">The next iteration was a massive overhaul. Score pips now spawn when you’re dealing damage, and at a higher rate when you’re “grazing” - which just means when you’re in danger but haven’t been hit (you can tell when you’re grazing because the screen gets lighter and your bullets change). The score multiplier doubled for every 10 pips you collect, halved if you left a score pip time out, and reset completely when you were hit. On top of all that, when you defeat the boss, all the bullets that are on screen are “cancelled”, and given to you as points that take your multiplier into account. That meant massive bonuses for defeating bosses <strong>at the right time</strong>, which means that if you want the highest scores, you need to stop shooting for a little bit and make sure the boss is shooting lots of bullets before dealing the final blow. To prevent excessive “milking” (which is intentionally not defeating a boss for long periods of time to get the best score), there was a bonus for quick completion, and a penalty for being too slow. And on top of <em>that</em>, there was also a bonus for not getting hit, and a penalty for getting hit twice. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">That iteration was a <strong>resounding success.</strong> It made the game so much more interesting, and we had a bunch of really great scoring competitions. That’s not to say there weren’t issues, though! Getting hit is <strong>heavily punished.</strong> You basically had to do a perfect run to get any chance at the top of the leaderboard, which makes mistakes incredibly demoralising. The multiplier reset <em>alone</em> was punishing enough, but to lose out on an extra 50% score boost at the end of the game just exacerbated the issue. On top of punishing getting hit too heavily, it also really over-prioritised precise, methodical movement. That’s kinda boring in a game that’s supposed to be a little bit chaotic, so it just didn’t meet the goals.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">So how do we fix that? Introducing <strong>@tntdragon</strong> - who dropped an absolute goldmine of information about scoring in the Discord server. If you’re in the server, just search “deathlessness” and you’ll find the post, I highly recommend reading it. There was a little bit of input from some other people in the server, but that post really shaped the next iteration. So what changed?</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">First things first, that death punishment was too much. Now it only halves the multiplier, and your multipler increases by <strong>one</strong> instead of doubling. There’s no explicit multiplier for not getting hit, too. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Score pips no longer expire! You can keep them all on the screen for as long as you like, but the multiplier now always decreases. It decreases faster the higher the multiplier, too, which can help incentivise that frenetic, chaotic movement that I was aiming for. They also spawn a lot more frequently, which means higher scores (which is always satisfying).</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">There are now extra life bonuses strewn through the levels, too. These have two purposes - they provide a bit of relief for newer players, which is absolutely necessary because this is quite a difficult game, but if you <strong>haven’t</strong> <strong>been hit</strong>, they give you a nice juicy bonus. Up to 32,000 extra points each, depending on your multiplier! That actually has an extra consequence - it means getting hit <em>after </em>the extra lives has spawned doesn’t really impact your score too much. Mistakes at the end of the battle (which tends to be a lot more difficult) are <strong>far less costly. </strong>Hooray!</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">The newer scoring system brings the game much closer to my vision, and makes playing for score a lot more interesting, and with less of a punishment for mistakes it’s also a lot less frustrating and more approachable. It’s not quite perfect, though, and I could really tweak it forever… I’m considering adding bonus points for letting score pips sit for longer - which would change the dynamic of gameplay a little! There’s also the possibility of doing the bullet -&gt; score conversion on phase changes, too. Lots more score, but also extra use of that mechanic and more reason to stop shooting. There might be a little test of that mechanic for the alpha testers in a few weeks, but it’s definitely not a priority.</p><h2 style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>What’s next?</strong></h2><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">That was a tangent, huh? Tomorrow will be some more work on the triangle twins. I might carry on doing a deeper dive of existing mechanics on a Thursday, too. I have a little bit of space to write without being able to do work on the game, it could be a good thing. Let me know what you think!</p>\n</div>\n<hr />",

The game has actually come so far in that time, I’m really pleased with progress. It’s probably time to take stock of what’s left.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">There are four levels to do, which feels like a lot given how long the previous three have taken (two years…). I think I’m <strong>probably</strong> going to have to pick up the pace there a little bit, no? 😂 I’m already a good chunk of the way through the triangle twins, though - there’ll be more to see there in the next few weeks.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">I’ve also got to write a little achievements handler and integrate Steam/Xbox social stuff. I’ve already got a skeleton in place, and everything is event-driven so it’s <strong>super</strong> flexible for things like that. Overengineered code coming in to the rescue!</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">I also need a couple of extra game modes - the current level select works for the demo, but the main way to play through the game should be consecutive levels, and they need to be locked in the level select menu until you’ve completed them. I’m also going to do a 1CC mode that is a full run through of the game with the same amount of lives and a score that continues between levels. I don’t really think this will take too long since again, everything is incredibly flexible - in fact, it’s in my plans for the next server competition <strong>with prizes</strong>. Join the mailing list at the bottom of the page to be the first to know about upcoming competitions. </p><h2 style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>What’s next?</strong></h2><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">For the next week, I’m going to be concentrating on getting an test of the triangle twins out to the alpha testers.

It… takes time. It’s really <em>really</em> useful, and generally leads to better quality shipped games and a faster build/test/release cycle, but I really can’t spend a few weeks going back and unit testing everything at this point. I wish I could, I wish I had infinite time, but alas - life gets in the way! </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Polyfury’s code is generally quite straightforward. When working in Unity (which is basically all I do), I like to keep everything as separated and reusable as possible - the health system, for example, is the same one I’ve used in every game for the last 5 years or more. It’s simple, it’s flexible, and it’s pretty well battle-tested by now! Most of the code is similar, so in theory it should be pretty stable. However, I have programmer brain rot and currently operate on much less sleep than I’d like, so mistakes will be made 😂</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Anyway, I hope you enjoyed that little tangent.

    "title": "Debugging Fast Laser Collisions: A Wild Goose Chase!",
    "content": "<div class=\"sqs-html-content\">\n <p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">I spent <strong>two hours</strong> (which is longer than I should’ve spent working on the game at all today) trying to work out fast rotating collision detection for the hexagon’s sweeping beams today.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Fast moving rotating collision bodies are a tricky problem to solve! Games like the new Legend Of Zelda make this stuff look really easy, but it’s not. Collision detection in games is basically all about faking it with maths, because doing proper simulations is really computationally expensive.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Unity’s 3D colliders (which use PhysX) have a setting for <a href=\"https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ContinuousCollisionDetection.html\">speculative continuous collision</a>, which <strong>should </strong>help with that in most cases, but comes at a performance cost. That cost is pretty small for me, since only the player has a rigidbody, and it only collides with the lasers. Everything else is my own bullet tech (<a href=\"https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/slug/199208?aid=1101lwk2s\">which you can buy on the Unity Asset Store</a> - n.b. this is an affiliate link which means I’ll earn a little bit of commission, but you won’t pay anything extra), which assumes all bullets are circles and don’t interact with each other, which makes it <strong>super speedy</strong>. There’s also some nice optimisation in that the player is always 15 units away from the centre, so I can just ignore any collisions that are less than 14 units and greater than 16 units from the centre.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">However, for some reason it just wasn’t working. It did not want to register collisions on this laser while it was rotating. It works fine for the square and the pentagon, right? Both are static lasers so it <strong>must</strong> be the fact that they are rotating. I tried a bunch of different combinations of rigidbody placement, I tried changing the player movement code so it moves the rigidbody (which it technically should be doing anyway because Unity treats colliders that don’t have rigidbodies as static, so moving them by their Transform component invalidates a bunch of caching), and nothing was working.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Finally, I tried making the lasers static, with no rotation at all. Just a big sustained stationary laser. And… </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">It didn’t work 😂</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Turns out it was just a stupid mistake I’d made 🙃 the code for enabling the lasers didn’t enable the colliders until the last bit of the animation. That was fine for the lasers in the square and pentagon levels, because they were very short lasers that didn’t stay on-screen for very long. There’s also a little bit of generosity - it only actually <strong>hits</strong> you if the laser hits you for more than a frame, which hid the problem even more.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>Sigh. </strong>I am not a smart man.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Anyway, it works properly now - even with easing to make the animation itself look a little bit less rigid:</p>\n</div>\n  <div>\n    <figure>\n     <div>\n      <div class=\"sqs-image-shape-container-element\n       has-aspect-ratio\n      \" \n       >\n        <img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/6086d006dce47b2b3ccc28ec/0dd7b9a1-c2b0-442a-8ec4-35aebd76aea9/ezgif.com-optimize%2810%29.gif\">\n      </div>\n     </div>\n    </figure>\n  </div>\n<div class=\"sqs-html-content\">\n <h2 style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>What’s next?</strong></h2><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Tomorrow I’ll clean up the rest of the hexagon boss - there are a couple of really cheap shots that are almost un-dodgeable, I want to make the danger nachos a little more… dangerous, and the centre of the laser in the gif above is a square, not a hexagon (I watched this gif so many times while writing this post that it’s seared into my retinas).</p>\n</div>\n<hr />\n<iframe src=\"https://assetstore.unity.com/linkmaker/embed/package/247937/widget-wide?aid=1101lwk2s&amp;wmode=opaque\" data-embed=\"true\" style=\"width:100%; height:130px; border:0px;\"></iframe><div class=\"video-caption-wrapper\"><div class=\"video-caption\"><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Making your own games?

    "content": "<div class=\"sqs-html-content\">\n <p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Spent most of the day doing game speed stuff. Absolutely everything needs to tie in to this game speed, so I’ve got a scriptable object that contains a game speed float. That float is set with a slider, and every single speed and time variable in the game gets multiplied or divided by that, respectively. E.g. bullet speed is multiplied (a speed of 10 would become a speed of 5 when the game speed is 0.5, for example), the time it takes a boss to move is divided (if it takes 0.5 seconds for the boss to move from the centre to the edge, it becomes 0.75 seconds with a game speed of 0.5).</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">This is great, but I’m yet to figure out a nice, consistent way of doing it. I’ve got a game speed scriptable object that I can use everywhere I need to, but that still requires me remembering to multiply everything by it! Setting Time.timeScale doesn’t work, since there are a few things that need to run independently of timescale - and it makes hitstop a LOT more complicated.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">For now I’ll just carry on doing it this way, maybe I just write some validation somewhere that checks against me being stupid. Because lets face it, I really can be 🥲</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">If you’ve got any suggestions, I’d love to hear them - post a comment down below!</p><h2 style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>What’s next?</strong></h2><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">The UI stuff is broadly there now, I need a break from it so I’ll move on to making balance tweaks for the Hexagon in preparation for the next round of testing. There are a few things that are too difficult, and one thing is completely broken - maybe I’ll do a deep dive on collision detection for fast-rotating objects tomorrow?</p>\n</div>\n<hr />\n<iframe src=\"https://assetstore.unity.com/linkmaker/embed/package/247937/widget-wide?aid=1101lwk2s&amp;wmode=opaque\" data-embed=\"true\" style=\"width:100%; height:130px; border:0px;\"></iframe><div class=\"video-caption-wrapper\"><div class=\"video-caption\"><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Making your own games?

I've been working on it for way too long, and I'm finally starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel.</p><h2 style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>Today</strong></h2><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">I'm all set up for 100 days of dev! I wrote down my to-do list and made sure everything was up on the repository. (Oops, it had been 6 months since my last commit! Don't do what I do. 🙃)</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">I also set up the blog on Squarespace and created a mailing list.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Oh, and I should probably get to work on the game! The first major bit of work for me to do is a reworking of the options menu to prepare for the final demo update. I'm adding some extra accessibility options and cheat codes, and I'm also cleaning up the code and fixing some controller bugs. I spent around 4 hours on all of this, here’s the changelog:</p><ul data-rte-list=\"default\"><li><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Deleted the old menu, because it was bad and broken. Making progress sometimes requires deleting a bunch of stuff 👍</p></li><li><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Added a new, better menu copied over from another project, with fancy tabbed navigation that works on a controller</p></li><li><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Fixed an issue where clicking somewhere with the mouse makes it impossible to navigate the menu</p></li><li><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Fixed a visual issue with cheat code entry</p></li></ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\n sqs-gallery-container\n sqs-gallery-block-grid\n sqs-gallery-aspect-ratio-widescreen\n sqs-gallery-thumbnails-per-row-2\n sqs-gallery-block-show-meta\n sqs-gallery-block-meta-only-title\n block-animation-none\n clear\"\n>\n <div class=\"sqs-gallery\">\n      <div class=\"slide\" data-type=\"image\" data-animation-role=\"image\">\n       <div class=\"margin-wrapper\">\n        <a\n           role=\"presentation\"\n          \n        >\n         <noscript><img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/6086d006dce47b2b3ccc28ec/1684422184391-CI7MOFSY3PPIMUC5IS5F/Screenshot+2023-05-18+at+15.48.17.png\"></noscript><img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/6086d006dce47b2b3ccc28ec/1684422184391-CI7MOFSY3PPIMUC5IS5F/Screenshot+2023-05-18+at+15.48.17.png\">\n        </a>\n         <div class=\"image-slide-title\">Before</div>\n       </div>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"slide\" data-type=\"image\" data-animation-role=\"image\">\n       <div class=\"margin-wrapper\">\n        <a\n           role=\"presentation\"\n          \n        >\n         <noscript><img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/6086d006dce47b2b3ccc28ec/1684422184879-5BFO80K14UIXDNUGGQLQ/Screenshot+2023-05-18+at+16.01.30.png\"></noscript><img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/6086d006dce47b2b3ccc28ec/1684422184879-5BFO80K14UIXDNUGGQLQ/Screenshot+2023-05-18+at+16.01.30.png\">\n        </a>\n         <div class=\"image-slide-title\">After</div>\n       </div>\n      </div>\n </div>\n</div>\n<style type=\"text/css\" id=\"design-grid-css\">\n#block-yui_3_17_2_1_1684422134159_3436 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -20px; }\n#block-yui_3_17_2_1_1684422134159_3436 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; }\n</style>\n<div class=\"sqs-html-content\">\n <h2 style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>What’s next?</strong></h2><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">By the weekend, I hope to be finished with the new menu bits.
