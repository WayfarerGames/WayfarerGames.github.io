summary: First post for the markdown-powered blog route.

# Welcome to the Wayfarer Devlog

This blog route now loads posts directly from a folder in the repo, so only committed files are shown.

## Why this setup

- No public upload form on the live page
- Posts are versioned in git with the rest of the site
- Keeping content in markdown makes writing updates fast

## How to add new posts

1. Add a `.md` file in `public/blog/posts/`
2. Add the filename to `public/blog/posts/posts.json`
3. Refresh `/blog/`

See you in the next update.
